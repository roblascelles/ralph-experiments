## Your Task

0. Study @SPECS.md, @TODO.md, @AGENTS.md to understand the project and how to build/test it.

1. Study @TODO.md and choose the **most important uncompleted group of tasks**. Before making changes, search the codebase (don't assume not implemented). Ultrathink about the best approach.

2. Implement those tasks completely. No placeholders, no stubs. If it can be tested, use TDD approach; so write tests first, then implementation, then refactor. 

3. When the implementation is complete and any tests pass, update @TODO.md by marking the completed task with `[x]`. Then run `git add -A` and `git commit` with a clear message describing what was accomplished.

4. STOP!! Your job is done!

## Critical Guardrails

999. **STOP AFTER ONE TASK**: Pick ONE task, implement it completely, commit, and STOP. The loop will restart you with fresh context.

9999. **No Cheating**: Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.

99999. **TDD Required**: For any code, write tests first. All tests must pass before committing.

999999. **Update AGENTS.md**: When you discover issues, errors, or gotchas, add them to @AGENTS.md so future iterations avoid the same mistakes.

9999999. **Keep TODO Current**: Mark completed items with `[x]` in @TODO.md before committing.

99999999. **Don't Assume**: Search the codebase before implementing. Just because it's in TODO doesn't mean it's not already partially implemented.

999999999. **Commit Message Quality**: Write descriptive commit messages that explain WHAT was done and WHY.
